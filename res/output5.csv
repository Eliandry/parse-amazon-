4,        Its slips while doing exercise and width is so smaller  
5,        Thick and suits all lengths  
5,        This yoga mat is the best Very thick cannot hurt your elbows and knees  
3,        Good for jumping exercises because its thick but the grip is not good N definitely not for yoga  
4,        Comfortable and thick which is good for support Doesnt feel like youre sitting on floor 1 because its a bit bulky to carry but not a deal breaker  
5,        Very comfortable but doesnt go with yoga coz its too thick  
4,        Its really good quality as well as soft and thick to use longer  
5,        recommended simple and comfortable at a great price dont look further thick and easy on the knees and hips bones  
5,        Very soft and thick so perfect for yoga Pilates I really recommend it  
5,        Ideal for home exercise routines as added padding increase comfort Good value for money  
5,        The foam is soft and not so thin Very good to do some exercises and Pilates I dont recommend for yoga since you need more stability on the stand up positions and this mat is soft After few uses I can notice some scratches but its fine for the price really worth it Dont use sneakers otherwise you will damage the mat

5,        Thick Soft Nonslippery and very comfortable Lovely colour too  
5,        I was surprised at how thick this yoga mat is which makes exercise or even just sitting on the floor quite comfortable

1,        Its a cheap product quality not good at all

4,        Mat is light weight and comfortable Value for money  
3,        It is soft and nice but very fragile in terms of quality  
3,        I had purple yoga mat and liked it very much especially its thickness so ordered red one 2nd time However they shipped me the one with dent mark Dont think they checked the quality before shippingwish I could attach a photo to share but looks like they dont keep such a menu  
4,        Received the product after a long wait due to the current crisis but Amazon delivered as per scheduled The product is worth for 35 AED I felt the quality is decent will see the durability in the long run I liked the color green rather I ordered for a grey  
5,        Very durable and thick It works great for my yoga poses and I love using it even for my cardio I will buy other colors too  
4,        Thick matt does its job
